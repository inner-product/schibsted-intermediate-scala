** Types vs Tests
*** Types
- Prove properties for all possible inputs
- Limited in what we can prove
  + Economic limitations
  + Theoretical limitations
*** Unit Testing
- Prove properties for single input
- Relatively cheap to produce
*** Property-based Testing
- What if we generated test inputs? (Generative testing)
- Cover more cases
- How do we write a test when the input is not known?
- Look for general properties that hold for any input in the set of generated values.
